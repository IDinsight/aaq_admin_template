CURRENT VERSION: aaq_admin_template: v1.0.1
# Deploying the AAQ Admin App

This is the deployment instructions for the **AAQ Admin App**. It does not cover deployment of the AAQ Core or UD Apps.

The AAQ Admin App provides a convenient interface to 
1. add to or modify content tables (`faqmatches` for FAQs, and `urgency_rules` if urgency detection is enabled), and
2. test new contents (new sets of tags for FAQs, and urgency rules if urgency detection is enabled).

# Initial setup

First set up the AAQ Core App (from `aaq_core_template`) and optionally the urgency detection app (from `aaq_ud_template`).

# Images

The Docker image for the core model server is hosted on AWS ECR at
`[AWS_ACCOUNT_ID].dkr.ecr.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/aaq_solution/aaq_admin_template:v1.0.1`

Your AWS user will need access to this resource. Please contact IDinsight for access.

## Resources for images

The Admin app doesn't require many resources as the heavy processing is done in the Core and UD apps.

## Image setup

* The inbound port mapping is 9903:9903 (TCP).
