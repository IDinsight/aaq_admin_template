This is the readme for the AAQ Template Admin App repository. To start development on a new AAQ solution, clone or fork this and follow the setup instructions below.

## What is the Admin App?

This is a containerized flask app that provides the following functionality:

If you clone this, please setup a new repository for future commits and add this repository as another remote - called `template`. This will allow you to pull in new changes made to this template. Here are the instructions on how to do this:

1. Clone this repo

```
git clone git@github.com:IDinsight/aaq_admin_template.git <project_name>
```

2. Change remote name to `template`

```
git remote rename origin template
```

3. Create a [new repo](https://github.com/organizations/IDinsight/repositories/new) in Github
4. Add it as remote for local repo

```
git remote add origin git@github.com:IDinsight/<project_name>.git
```
5. Set local to track that remote

```
git push -u origin main
```

### Configure project details

The `project_config.cfg` in the root directory should be updated with your project details.

### Initialise

#### `make setup-dev`

This command does the following:

1. Creates a `conda` virtual environment
2. Installs dependencies from `requirements.txt` and `requirements_dev.txt`
3. Installs pre-commit hooks
4. Creates secrets files in `./secrets/`
